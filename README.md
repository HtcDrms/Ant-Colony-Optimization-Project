===============================
Built using C#

Follows ant colony optimization's basic principles as shown in:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms
  
Independent agents called 'ants' iterate through the placed cities.
Cities are nodes connected by edges.
For good cities 'pheromones' are incremented on that edge to make
it more favorable.  Pheromones help work against the possible 
unfavorable condition of long distant edges between cities.
